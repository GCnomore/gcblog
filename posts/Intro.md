## Who am I?

- ❌ Computer science major
- ❌ Senior level developer

## How I ended up here

I saw CMS as a requirement from many job postings, so I was digging Strapi and thought this is perfect for building a blog.<br/>
Step 2, went straight to Youtube and searched for `How to build blog`. Thanks to Brad Traversy.

## What will I be posting

I'll be posting about things I've learned, currently learning, and topics that I had struggled on as a coding beginner.

## Why am I doing this

I used to think writing blog will slow me down to grow my skill set as developer, but I changed my mind. <br/>
This will be my recap of what I learned and I **just feel like** there will be more to take away than this.

**But will someone ever read my blog?...**
