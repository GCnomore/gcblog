## Who am I?

- ❌ Computer science major
- ❌ Senior level developer

## How I ended up here

I saw CMS as a requirement from many job postings, so I was digging Strapi and thought this is perfect for building a blog.<br/>
Step 2, went straight to Youtube and searched for `How to build blog`. Thanks to Brad Traversy.

## What will I be posting

I'll be posting about things I've learned, currently learning, and topics that I had struggled on as a coding beginner.

## Why am I doing this

I used to think writing blog will slow me down to grow my skill set as developer, but I changed my mind. <br/>
This will be my recap of what I learned and I **just feel like** there will be more to take away than this.
<br/>
<br/>

**But will someone ever read my blog?...**
<br/>
<br/>

## Short term focus and plans

1. Since this is a blog, I will need to write some articles first.
2. Implement Strapi before the blog gets too big (I wish...)
3. Sort by category and side menu.
4. Filter with tags.
5. Search feature.
6. Some more stylings and review responsiveness.

**=========EDIT=========**
<br/>
Just came with a good reason why I shoud blog.

1. Practice my dying English skill.
2. Improve my writing skill.
3. Improve skill to explain tech stuffs to non-tech people.
